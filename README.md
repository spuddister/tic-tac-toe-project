# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

For this project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Curriculum in the Javascript course, I built this Tic-Tac-Toe game to showcase my knowledge of modules, namespacing, and object oriented programming..

### New Skills
  - Scope and Closure
  - Private Variables and Functions
  - Factory Functions
  - The Module Pattern (big fan of this!)
  - IIFEs
